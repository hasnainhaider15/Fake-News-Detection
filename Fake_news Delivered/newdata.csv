Rector NUML Major General (Retd) Muhammad Jaffar in his speech said that NUML is proud to host this conference which in its own way addresses a very pertinent and contemporary issue. In the present age of media warfare
 the nations with weaker media strategies are highly vulnerable to the forces of propaganda
 misinformation as well as disinformation. Today
 we are facing the battles of discourses and wars of narratives. These wars are exceedingly more subtle and more delicate than the armed conflict and open military standoffs. Such wars are fought in the virtual and simulated battlefields of media. He thanked the chief guest and all the worthy speakers. It is important to mention that 70 papers on different aspects of media will be presented in the conference by the research scholars across the country.

Speaking on the occasion
 Masood said that war for Kashmir is war for Pakistan and independence of Kashmir is pivotal for the survival of Pakistan. He said that fascist Indian regime should reverse the actions taken on August 5
 2019 and United Nations must admit that Kashmir is not a bilateral issue but an international dispute. He said that Indian fascist regime was trying to manipulate right of self-determination. Fighting for independence cannot be called terrorism but having 9 million army in Indian occupied Kashmir is certainly an act of terrorism. He said that people of Pakistan should remain clear as people of Kashmir wanted to join Pakistan. He also praised the sacrifices of Kashmiri leaders like Burhan Wani
 Maqbool Butt
 Yasin Malik
 Syed Ali Gilani
 Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and others. He criticised international community for not opening their lips over the brutality of Indian army just because of some economic benefits perhaps. He thanked China
 Turkey
 Iran
 Malaysia
 Finland
 and Germany for supporting Kashmir and Kashmiri people on international forums.

The Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) and the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) had submitted review petitions. AIOU’s counsel argued before the bench that from 1995 to 2001
 the varsity had received no notice to pay any kind of tax.

AIOU’s counsel further contended that the high court had ordered both universities to pay tax from 1995 but both universities had challenged it in the superior court. He went on to argue that as is a precedence in various cases
 petitions become infructuous.

At this
 the state prosecutor said that only government and semi-government institutions were initially exempt from paying taxes
 but this changed after tax was imposed according to a notification in 1995. Now
 he said
 only welfare organisations are exempt from tax.

A student Mohammad Irfan said that the first brawl occurred two days ago when two students exchanged harsh words with each other.  Following the heated argument
 students gathered a 7-up Chowk outside the university where a violent clash took place.  The student said that the situation went out of control and the police had to intervene and take some in custody at I-9 police station. He said that the injured students were shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) for treatment but again clashed and were taken to the police station of Karachi Company G-9.

The university official in his reply also said that BASR in its 4th meeting struck off all such scholars who could not fulfill any of the requirements for award of degree despite availing extra duration/ extensions after issuance of SOR letter it is not possible to reopen a case of an individual as it will not only be a violation of rules but would also compromise the standard of quality of the degree beside undermining the authority of BASR.

The faculty members said that their fundamental job is to teach the students and yield desiring academic results
 adding that marking attendance like this is a secondary obligation in universities across the world. However
 they said
 the NUML administration is focusing more on attendance instead of making certain policies to keep check on their teaching performance.

In another interesting statement
 it was instructed that the officers/clerical staff working in those departments who don’t take break from 2pm to 3:30pm can exit at 5pm and onwards with approval of concerned director. A senior official in the administration lamented that humanly it’s not possible to incessantly work from 8:30am to 5pm without any interval. Moreover
 he said
 such officials are also receiving double shift salaries which are quite illegal as they are single shift employees of the university.

Moot on education starts at NUML
"Islamabad : Two-day National Conference on Education titled ‘Education in 21st Century: Expectations, Challenges, and Possibilities’ organised by Education department, faculty of Social Sciences started here at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Wednesday, says a press release."
"The chief guest of the inaugural session was Prof. Dr. Anees Ahmed, Vice Chancellor Riphah International University, while Rector NUML Major General (Retd) Muhammad Jaffar, Director General Brig Muhammad Ibrahim, Deans, Directors, Heads of Departments, scholars from various universities of Pakistan, faculty members and students also attended the session."
"Speaking on the occasion chief guest Prof. Dr. Anees Ahmed said that prevailing education system is borrowed from the west, which gives knowledge but not wisdom. We once a colonial nation never tried to think critically and never think what Quaid-e-Azam and Iqbal said. While referring to the Quaid’s speech on the first education conference in Dec 1947, Dr. Anees said that according to the Quaid Pakistan needed an education system in which character building should be focused but we never followed our great leader."
"Professor Dr. Anees said that current education system is prison of ideas of the west and we blindly following them, not knowing the fact that this system is hampering the minds of our youth. You can get knowledge but you cannot get wisdom from the current education system. He further said that China, Japan, France and Russia focused on one language at national level and all their programs are in their own languages yet they excel in every field at global level and on other hand we never gives such importance to our national language. “I am not against the indigenous languages but we have to have one language at national level”, he said. He elaborated that there are many native languages and culture in China but you will never see them saying as our fellow Pakistani like Punjabi, Pashtoon, Sindhi, Sarakai, Balouchi and Urdu speakers say."
"
Earlier, Rector NUML Major General (r) Muhammad Jaffar in his welcoming address said that education is imperative and inevitable for us in every thinkable walk of life. Let us remind ourselves through this conference how much it is important for us to realize and acknowledge the role of education with all its dynamics in present day Pakistan."
"The rector said that NUML is known to have paved paths for the promotion of research and improved and adaptable educational paradigms. It is moving ahead with considerable efficacy and system. NUML believes that the essential rule of education is research and it has a fundamental role in the development of civilization. The higher standards in research adopted by our faculty and scholars are far encouraging. These will not only expand possibilities of education domestically but also escalate our cultural worth globally. Both research and education thrive upon constructive attitudes of life and restore intellect and knowledge. As a nation, such solemn ideals and practices are needed. Gladly, NUML is playing a commendable role in this regard"

Legal forum for oppressed voices of Kashmir (LFOVK) wrote a Legal Memorandum to the United Nation Secretary General (UNSG) and all Members of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) requesting an urgent and immediate Intervention in the Illegal Annexation of Disputed Jammu and Kashmir by India.
"The memorandum recaps about the final status of the former princedom of Jammu and Kashmir has remained unsettled since 1947. The state of Jammu and Kashmir before the partition of India and Pakistan was princely sovereign statehood with its independent legislative, executive and judicial institutions."
LFOVK in its appeal urged UNSC and UNSG that Indian action of annexing Jammu Kashmir and incorporating as Union Territoryhas blatantly violated the International law.
LFOVK in its appeal urged UNSC and UNSG that Indian action of annexing Jammu Kashmir and incorporating as Union Territoryhas blatantly violated the International law.
"Citing the example of governing Israel illegal de jure Annexation of Golan Heights and Jerusalem, this Indian law which unlawfully annexed Jammu Kashmir is also to be seen as null and void and lacks any legal effect."
"Director LFOVK, Advocate Nasir Qadri, while commenting on memorandum said, “We urge UNSC and UNSG that Government of India shall comply with its international obligations in Occupied Kashmir pursuant to UNSC Resolution and other bilateral treaties and international covenants.”"
"The memorandum requests UNSC and UNSG to refer this case of illegal annexation and demographic change in disputed Jammu Kashmir for Advisory opinion to International court of Justice (ICJ), ensure independent war crime tribunal for disputed Jammu Kashmir, and government of India should respect and protect the fundamental rights of the people of Occupied Jammu Kashmir, including freedom of speech and expression"

2-day int’l conference on Kashmir starts at NUML
"Islamabad, Dec 24 (KMS): Two-day international conference on Kashmir titled “From Gardens to Graves: Kashmir in Resolutions and Solutions” started at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML). The conference was organised by the Department of International Relations, Faculty of Social Sciences (NUML) in collaboration with Sophy’s Forum Faculty of Languages, NUML. The President Azad Jammu and Kashmir Sardar Masood was the chief guest on the inaugural session while Rector NUML Major General (Retd) Muhammad Jaffar, Director General NUML Brig Muhammad Ibrahim, speakers from UK, USA, Turkey and occupied Kashmir, guests, speakers, faculty members and students also attended the ceremony."
"Speaking on the occasion, Masood said that war for Kashmir is war for Pakistan and independence of Kashmir is pivotal for the survival of Pakistan. He said that fascist Indian regime should reverse the actions taken on August 5, 2019 and United Nations must admit that Kashmir is not a bilateral issue but an international dispute. He said that Indian fascist regime was trying to manipulate right of self-determination. Fighting for independence cannot be called terrorism but having 9 million army in Indian occupied Kashmir is certainly an act of terrorism. He said that people of Pakistan should remain clear as people of Kashmir wanted to join Pakistan. He also praised the sacrifices of Kashmiri leaders like Burhan Wani, Maqbool Butt, Yasin Malik, Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and others. He criticised international community for not opening their lips over the brutality of Indian army just because of some economic benefits perhaps. He thanked China, Turkey, Iran, Malaysia, Finland, and Germany for supporting Kashmir and Kashmiri people on international forums."
"At the end, Rector NUML Major General (Retd) Muhammad Jaffar expressed his grave concerns over the silence of United Nations on its own resolution about Kashmir and hoped that someday the sacrifices of Kashmiri people will get UN attention."
"Ever wonder that if you were ever asked to live in the city of your dreams, where would it be? Well… considering you have to find a location in Pakistan, Defence Housing Authority has some great projects lined up for you. At the edge of the Cholistan Desert, DHA Bahawalpur is indeed a value addition project that serves as a junction for Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, keeping you closer to three provinces of the country."
"The project highlights the most beautiful aspects of the 11th largest city of Pakistan, Bahawalpur and invites in investors from all over the country and aboard, paving a road to Pakistan’s economic revival through real estate. It is the first planned community of such scale in the area which has set standards for other modern developmental projects."
"Inimitable DHA Bhawalpur is in progressive negotiations with international and local joint venture partners for recreational animality services. As per the current state, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) have been signed with Shaukat Khanum, Nation Defense University and National University of Modern Languages (NUML) while many are in the stream."
Here is an insight into why DHA Bahawalpur is a city of your dreams:
"The chief guest of the inaugural session was Prof Dr Anees Ahmed, Vice Chancellor Riphah International University, while Rector NUML Major General (r) Muhammad Jaffar, Director General Brig Muhammad Ibrahim, deans, directors, heads of departments, scholars from various universities of Pakistan, faculty members and students also attended the session."
"Speaking on the occasion, Prof Dr Anees Ahmed said that prevailing education system is borrowed from the west, which gives knowledge but not wisdom. “We once a colonial nation never tried to think critically and never think what Quaid-e-Azam and Iqbal said,” he said. While referring to the Quaid’s speech on the first education conference in Dec 1947, Dr Anees said that according to the Quaid Pakistan needed an education system in which character building should be focused but we never followed our great leader."
"Professor Anees said that current education system is prison of ideas of the west and we blindly following them, not knowing the fact that this system is hampering the minds of our youth. You can get knowledge but you cannot get wisdom from the current education system. He further said that China, Japan, France and Russia focused on one language at national level and all their programs are in their own languages yet they excel in every field at global level and on other hand we never give such importance to our national language. “I am not against the indigenous languages but we have to have one language at national level,”he said. He elaborated that there are many native languages and culture in China but you will never see them saying as our fellow Pakistani like Punjabi, Pashtoon, Sindhi, Sarakai, Balouchi and Urdu speakers say."
"Earlier, Rector NUML Major General (r) Muhammad Jaffar in his welcoming address "
"The International Relations Department at National University of Modern Languages (NUML) and Sophy’s Forum, organised a 2-day International Conference titled “From Gardens To Graves: Kashmir In Resolutions And Solutions” on 23-24 December 2019 at the University. Prof. Dr. Shahid Siddiqui, Prof. Dr. Adnan Sarwar, Dr. Sarwat and Ms. Rabia Aamir, a team of student volunteers, Director General, NUML, Brigadier Muhammad Ibrahim, Rector NUML, Major General Muhammad Jaffar HI (M), and others at the two institutions, had made best efforts to attract speakers from all disciplines of life from Pakistan and from outside."
"President of Azad Kashmir Sardar Masood Khan and Syed Fakhar Imam, Chairman, Special Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir were chief guests in two different sessions. Such a big effort could not have been possible without the hard work of organising committee and many more behind the scene. President of Azad Kashmir, very rightly said, that “it is always today, to act. Rather it should have been yesterday.” Chairman Kashmir Committee encouraged to keep faith."
"Presentations and the debates in various sessions, were great independent inputs. They need further examination by experts and later made part of the future policy, in seeking the vacation of Indian military occupation of Kashmir and taking the people through a UN supervised vote. The differing schools of opinion and differing approaches, could be reconciled, for a credible action template. Conferences on Kashmir have remained a routine and a kind of competitive reflexes between groups and individuals. We find a complete disjoint and an amoebic crawl between these exercises on Kashmir and have failed to structure a common point where all these efforts could be parked for a further comparative and competitive examination."
One finds a commons sin being committed by many of us who appear for Kashmir at these Conferences. India has succeeded over the years to mount a psychological pressure in her favour and make us walk in her footprints on the UN position on Kashmir. India wants us to step down from the UN mechanism on Kashmir and seek any other way forward. Why? India should have a subterranean and concealed motive. Some of us may be making this error of being tagged along under Indian influence in good faith or this school wants to appear liberal and forward looking at the cost of the principle of “equality of Peoples” and right of “Self-Determination”.
"United Nations has defined the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the territories of Jammu and Kashmir. Until early 1990, no Kashmiri Muslim, Pandit, Sikh, Christian, Jew, Budh or a non-faith Kashmiri, has challenged the Kashmiris right to self-determination. All found themselves represented in the UN definition of the people. Kashmir has been at the UN for the last 71 years and the present Government is on record to have said that “we did not raise it at the UN for the last 54 years”. We tend to blame the UN and international community, without any merit. In fact we are still dithering under Indian influence and do not want to seek compliance from India, as required under UN Security Council Resolutions."
"UN has been jointly approached by India and Pakistan, to assist them in arranging a free, secure and fair Plebiscite in Kashmir. As a consequence United Nations gave a plan to conduct a UN supervised vote in Kashmir. It appointed the UN Representative for India and Pakistan to carry out a demilitarization and appointed Plebiscite Administrator to conduct the UN supervised Plebiscite. We have an inclusive definition of People, identification of territories and a mechanism to carry out a Plebiscite. It is based on solemn agreements between India and Pakistan and endorsed by the UN Security Council. It has been a life time consensus and turning our backs on it, would leave us vulnerable and impotent against the broad spread of Indian influence around the world."
"As long as we continue to hold on to the UN jurisprudence on the Kashmir case, India continues to remain helpless and weak. India will use her friends to infiltrate in the school of opinion that supports the UN jurisprudence on Kashmir case and encourage another school who would offer weak arguments that it is a 70 year old story and we should move on. It would be like encouraging us to walk over a cliff in the darkness and leaving the lantern at home. India has succeeded to influence many in Pakistan to admit this argument and volunteer to walk into a wilderness, in pitch dark, to find a lamp, instead of walking towards the definitive position of a UN lamp."
"Finding a new consensus as opposed to UN mechanism on Kashmir, would take centuries and at the end we shall have to settle down with the status quo. In that case we shall have to account for the death of a generation and the loss of honour by every man, woman, child and elderly in Kashmir. India had offered “sky is the limit” to the people of Kashmir in 1994. If 194 countries of the UN could not pin down India to comply with UN package on Kashmir, Pakistan on its own has no chance to help the people of Kashmir, sans the UN template. We need to be careful."
"The news that Saudi Arabia is planning to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of member states of OIC for a discussion on the situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir would have warmed the hearts and hopes of Kashmiris living all around the world. Kashmiri Diaspora is an enormous constituency, sitting in various Parliaments and in all disciplines, in these countries."
"Saudi spiritual leadership would prevail through all times if it has a credible political component as well. The litmus test is how it responds to rights regimes in their respective member countries and in particular “Rights and Dignity” and “Security and Self Determination” of (all people) Muslims in Kashmir, who have been aggressed , occupied and imprisoned by Indian army from August 5. India has violated the obligations accepted under UN Resolutions and UNCIP Resolutions on Kashmir. OIC rather than repeating or causing a new resolution, should make a formal reference to the UN. It should encourage and support the NGOs working on Kashmir."
"OIC has to measure itself against the example of Catholic Church and find out the manner in which Catholic Church has backed Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR) in the independence struggle of East Timor. They looked for support beyond the contours of Catholic Church. IPJET reached out to Muslim Experts as well. As a British Kashmiri Muslim, I served on the IPJET (International Platform of Jurists for East Timor) from 1985 until East Timor achieved its independence"
"The hosting of OIC Foreign Ministers meeting on Kashmir would help to heal the wrong done to Kashmir by the absence of Pakistan at Kuala Lumpur Summit. Kashmiris are known for their sense of gratitude. Saudi leadership needs to assume the twin roles of leading the Muslim world on spiritual front and bonding it with the political interests of Muslims around the world. An error of judgement or an imbalance in either case would be disastrous, for Saudi prestige on world forums and badly sag the love that sits in the hearts of every Muslim around the globe for Saudia."

UN representative slams Egyptian president’s remarks
"However, no security staff or administration was found present in the campus to control the situation. An official said that the students’ affairs are being weakly managed in the university."
"Official said that according to normal practice, a faculty member is given the post of student affairs in the university because students are naturally bowed before their teachers. He said that in such situation the students are reluctant to take orders from the strict administration."
Spokesperson NUML Mohammad Bilal talking to The Nation said that no fight between students took place inside the premises of the university.
"He clarified that few days back a verbal clash occurred between students in the university, but the physical assault took place outside the university premises."

"NUML Students, Staff Donates Blood"
APP - Associated Press Of Pakistan  2 years ago  Mon 05th March 2018 | 05:30 PM
"A large number of students, faculty and staff members gathered here on Monday to the blood donation camp at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) to donate blood for thalassemia and other patient"
"ISLAMABAD, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 05th Mar, 2018 ) :A large number of students, faculty and staff members gathered here on Monday to the blood donation camp at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) to donate blood for thalassemia and other patient."
"Director Administration NUML Brig (R) Zia ul Hassan Sahi alongwith Dr Amina and Director Student Affairs Nazir Ahmed visited the blood donation camp, a news release said. He appreciate the students and said that the practice of voluntarily blood donating is low in Pakistan."
"Such drives will encourage young students to go for voluntary donations. He said that NUML always welcomed the community services and social work to help the needy. The donation camp was arranged by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and donation drive drew a huge response from the students, faculty members and staff and especially girls who turned up to donate blood for children suffering from thalassemia and other patients."
"Assistant Director PRCS Dr Wasifa Mutassim said that blood donation collected from NUML will be used for thalassemia, anemia, accidents or emergencies, hemophilia and cancer patients. She said that PRCS was striving hard to facilitate the deprived and needy patients."
"She thanked NUML administration for helping in setting up a blood donation camp in the varsity and she also lauded the passion of students, faculty and staff in donating blood."
We are living at a time when whole world is busy in countering the coronavirus outbreak and every government is trying to save its citizens from the effects caused by spread of this pandemic. Most of the media analysts and economists are trying to calculate the negative economic impacts posed to different countries affected by the spread of COVID-19.
"Due to large impact of this pandemic, the global economy is shrinking; imports and exports are falling; same goes for oil prices. Tourism and airlines industries are also facing the worst crisis of this century, resulting in huge financial loss to them."
"Other than this new coronavirus, there is another virus getting less importance in international media. A virus which infected the global conscience and as a result of which conscience of global community is sleeping. The more severe challenge as compared to ‘economic shrinking’ is the ‘sinking of humanity’."
The world is plunging into total chaos; things are getting worse day by day. New calamities – human-made and natural – have been wreaking havoc on humanity. Only time will tell to what extent humans will survive.
"Recently, Syrian observatory for human rights released its report on completion of a decade of war in Syria. According to this report 1, 60,000 civilians died (among them 22,000 children and 16,000 women) and 11 million Syrian people became refugees during this ten years of war."
"Similarly, in Afghanistan thousands of civilians got killed in 18 years of war. Civilian casualties are still happening every day in Yemen, Palestine, Iraq and Myanmar. Economies and infrastructure of these countries got destroyed completely by the wars waged on their territories by international powers for their own petty interests. No one opposed them and stopped them at that time and still there is no one to stop them, as they continue playing their proxy wars with the blood and flesh of poor human beings living in war zones.    "
"This is a very alarming situation that the exams for matriculation and also the Cambridge school system were to be held this month, have been postponed. And, as the numbers of COVID-19 positive cases are increasing day by day, it is expected that the period for the closure of educational institutions will further be extended. In this critical situation, it has been decided by the Higher Education Commission to hold online classes so that the term of the semester in universities may not be increased. But, this has still been remaining a challenge on how to manage the online class system?"
"Even in many rural areas and the countryside, people have no access to electricity properly"
"The online learning system is not a new phenomenon in Pakistan, as the distance learning programs have already been run in the country but the scope of these programs has remained very limited. The Virtual University and Allama Iqbal University are vivid examples in this regard. Still, the question arises that is this possible for all the students countrywide to participate in this online learning process? I am sure the answer is No because Pakistan is not only a developing country but is also far away from the digitalization process that the West, Europe, and even China are experiencing. Despite this, according to the United Nations, “More than 770 million learners worldwide are now being affected by school and university closures.” Even China, being a second-largest economy of the world, had faced many challenges when the Chinese authorities announced the online learning system during the severity of COVID-19 in China."
"Chairman, Senate Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed Monday said that Pakistan always stood with the oppressed countries in the world."
"He was addressing a seminar on ""Together for Peace and Humanity, End to Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide"" was jointly organized by the Department of International Relations of the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) and the embassy of Azerbaijan."
"The seminar was also attended by the Ali Alizada, the ambassador of Azerbaijan, Sakib Foric, the ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina, ambassadors and high commissioners of various Central Asian States, Middles East and Africa, Director General NUML Brig Muhammad Ibrahim, former president Azad Jammu and Kashmir Sardar Anwar Khan, Deans, Directors, Heads of Departments and a large number of students."
"Speaking on the occasion as chief guest, he said that Pakistan had no diplomatic relations with Armenia just because of genocide they commit in Nagorno-Karabakh and to support its brother country Azerbaijan."
"In his argument, he further said that in Africa where Pakistan even did not have any interest but support Morroco on a principal stand."
"While referring to Palestine, he stated that Pakistan always stood firm against the oppressor Israel."
In his address on the occasion the ambassador of Azerbaijan Ali Alizada said that Kashmir was close to our hearts and minds and his country was concerned about the human rights violations by the Indian Army in Indian Occupied Kashmir.
He said that Azerbaijan supported that Kashmir dispute must be resolved according to the United Nations Resolution and would support Pakistan's stance in that regard.
The ambassador said that his own country Azerbaijan was facing the same situation as Armenia had continued to illegally occupy around 20% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognized territory including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts.
"He said that in February 1992, the whole Azerbaijan watched in horror as their TV screens showed the aftermath of a brutal killing: dead children, women and elderly people, mutilated bodies, frozen corpses scattered across the ground."
"This shocking footage was taken at the site of the Khojaly massacre the worst war crime in the Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and one of the worst in modern European history."
"At least 613 Azerbaijani civilians, including over 200 women and children, were ruthlessly killed."
He thanked Pakistan for support on this issue and applauded the role of Pakistan Army in war against terror in recent era.
The Ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina Sakib Foric also addressed and highlighted his country's war time era and praised Pakistan for its support Bosnia on international fronts.
"At the end, Director General NUML Brig Muhammad Ibrahim thanked all the participants and presented shields among the dignitaries."

"An increasing number of Pakistanis are learning the Chinese language, hoping to land a job in one of the multi-billion-dollar CPEC projects. Some experts see the trend as China's cultural onslaught on Pakistani society. Photo: Deutsche Welle"
"In the past few years – mainly after the announcement of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project in 2015 – there has been an unprecedented surge in the number of students wanting to learn Chinese, said Misbah Rasheed, a Chinese language instructor at the Islamabad-based National University of Modern Languages (NUML)."
"Prior to CPEC we had some 200 students learning Chinese. Now we have over 2,000 in our different programs, Rasheed told DW."
"Rasheed said the university established a Chinese language department in the 1970s solely for the purpose of familiarizing Pakistani military officials with Chinese culture. Later, the department was opened to common citizens also."
"There has been a sudden interest in learning Chinese – mainly the most-spoken Mandarin variety in China – in the Islamic country. Experts say it is a result of the multibillion-dollar CPEC initiative, which is mainly a trade route, but will also generate jobs in Pakistan."
"In 2015, China announced CPEC worth $46 billion (41 billion euros). With the project, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter US and Indian influence. CPEC also includes plans to create road, rail and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East."
Pakistan is grappling with an acute economic crisis. Experts say that CPEC can certainly stir the much-needed economic activity in the country.
"As a result of an increasing demand for knowledge about China, many private institutions have also started offering Mandarin courses."

"Department of Korean at NUML, established in 2006, is the pioneer Korean language institute in Pakistan. It now has now reached up to 180 students per semester."
"Young Pakistanis are now passionately devoting their time to learn other languages. At the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) in Islamabad — Pakistan’s oldest and esteemed foreign language institute — classes of Chinese, German, French and Korean are crowded with students, says Dr Anwer Mahmoud, dean of Faculty Languages at NUML and PhD in German."
"Key officials of the education sector and rehabilitation centers have expressed astonishment over the figures quoted by the state minister of students in the city who are addicted to drugs. They even doubted the survey exercise in the city’s schools and colleges and declared the claim of the minister as an irresponsible statement. “Where is that survey? If the claim is right then it’s the failure of the local police and Anti-Narcotics Force which failed to stop the menace,” said Prof Tahir Malik at National University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad. He said samples, statistics and results of the survey are shared for public information. “If the situation is so grave, the government should declare war against narcotics,” he opined. "

This is gross violation of PM Office OM/foreign Posting guidelines,” it says."
"A practicing journalist and faculty member at Mass Communications department of NUML who himself was an applicant for the foreign posting when advertised in September 2015, participated in preparation & checking of papers. "
The letter mentioned a number of officers not eligible according to the Estacode guideline for foreign postings abroad & prime minister’s directives who were invited for test and interview.
"Seven officers who have availed foreign posting and are in promotion zone are invited for the test and interview.

He presented the historical and current overview of the situation in the Valley and said that Pakistan will support Kashmir at every forum. He thanked chief guest Masood and other guests for attending this conference.
One finds a commons sin being committed by many of us who appear for Kashmir at these Conferences. India has succeeded over the years to mount a psychological pressure in her favour and make us walk in her footprints on the UN position on Kashmir. India wants us to step down from the UN mechanism on Kashmir and seek any other way forward. Why? India should have a subterranean and concealed motive. Some of us may be making this error of being tagged along under Indian influence in good faith or this school wants to appear liberal and forward looking at the cost of the principle of “equality of Peoples” and right of “Self-Determination”.
"United Nations has defined the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the territories of Jammu and Kashmir. Until early 1990, no Kashmiri Muslim, Pandit, Sikh, Christian, Jew, Budh or a non-faith Kashmiri, has challenged the Kashmiris right to self-determination. All found themselves represented in the UN definition of the people. Kashmir has been at the UN for the last 71 years and the present Government is on record to have said that “we did not raise it at the UN for the last 54 years”. We tend to blame the UN and international community, without any merit. In fact we are still dithering under Indian influence and do not want to seek compliance from India, as required under UN Security Council Resolutions."
"UN has been jointly approached by India and Pakistan, to assist them in arranging a free, secure and fair Plebiscite in Kashmir. As a consequence United Nations gave a plan to conduct a UN supervised vote in Kashmir. It appointed the UN Representative for India and Pakistan to carry out a demilitarization and appointed Plebiscite Administrator to conduct the UN supervised Plebiscite. We have an inclusive definition of People, identification of territories and a mechanism to carry out a Plebiscite. It is based on solemn agreements between India and Pakistan and endorsed by the UN Security Council. It has been a life time consensus and turning our backs on it, would leave us vulnerable and impotent against the broad spread of Indian influence around the world."
"As long as we continue to hold on to the UN jurisprudence on the Kashmir case, India continues to remain helpless and weak. India will use her friends to infiltrate in the school of opinion that supports the UN jurisprudence on Kashmir case and encourage another school who would offer weak arguments that it is a 70 year old story and we should move on. It would be like encouraging us to walk over a cliff in the darkness and leaving the lantern at home. India has succeeded to influence many in Pakistan to admit this argument and volunteer to walk into a wilderness, in pitch dark, to find a lamp, instead of walking towards the definitive position of a UN lamp."
"Finding a new consensus as opposed to UN mechanism on Kashmir, would take centuries and at the end we shall have to settle down with the status quo. In that case we shall have to account for the death of a generation and the loss of honour by every man, woman, child and elderly in Kashmir. India had offered “sky is the limit” to the people of Kashmir in 1994. If 194 countries of the UN could not pin down India to comply with UN package on Kashmir, Pakistan on its own has no chance to help the people of Kashmir, sans the UN template. We need to be careful."
"The news that Saudi Arabia is planning to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of member states of OIC for a discussion on the situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir would have warmed the hearts and hopes of Kashmiris living all around the world. Kashmiri Diaspora is an enormous constituency, sitting in various Parliaments and in all disciplines, in these countries."
"Saudi spiritual leadership would prevail through all times if it has a credible political component as well. The litmus test is how it responds to rights regimes in their respective member countries and in particular “Rights and Dignity” and “Security and Self Determination” of (all people) Muslims in Kashmir, who have been aggressed , occupied and imprisoned by Indian army from August 5. India has violated the obligations accepted under UN Resolutions and UNCIP Resolutions on Kashmir. OIC rather than repeating or causing a new resolution, should make a formal reference to the UN. It should encourage and support the NGOs working on Kashmir."
"OIC has to measure itself against the example of Catholic Church and find out the manner in which Catholic Church has backed Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR) in the independence struggle of East Timor. They looked for support beyond the contours of Catholic Church. IPJET reached out to Muslim Experts as well. As a British Kashmiri Muslim, I served on the IPJET (International Platform of Jurists for East Timor) from 1985 until East Timor achieved its independence"
"The hosting of OIC Foreign Ministers meeting on Kashmir would help to heal the wrong done to Kashmir by the absence of Pakistan at Kuala Lumpur Summit. Kashmiris are known for their sense of gratitude. Saudi leadership needs to assume the twin roles of leading the Muslim world on spiritual front and bonding it with the political interests of Muslims around the world. An error of judgement or an imbalance in either case would be disastrous, for Saudi prestige on world forums and badly sag the love that sits in the hearts of every Muslim around the globe for Saudia."

ISLAMABAD-A violent clash occurred between two students group of National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Wednesday leaving several injured.  Sources informed The Nation students of Punjab and Baloch councils clashed for the second time in a week on a minor issue.
"A student Mohammad Irfan said that the first brawl occurred two days ago when two students exchanged harsh words with each other.

The student said that the situation went out of control and the police had to intervene and take some in custody at I-9 police station. He said that the injured students were shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) for treatment but again clashed and were taken to the police station of Karachi Company G-9."
He added that the students were released by the police after giving strict warnings. Another student Ibrahim informed The Nation that the issue remained unresolved between the students and students clashed again. The footage of the brawl available with The Nation shows that the fight took place outside the faculty of management sciences.

"However, no security staff or administration was found present in the campus to control the situation. An official said that the students’ affairs are being weakly managed in the university."
"Official said that according to normal practice, a faculty member is given the post of student affairs in the university because students are naturally bowed before their teachers. He said that in such situation the students are reluctant to take orders from the strict administration."
We are living at a time when whole world is busy in countering the coronavirus outbreak and every government is trying to save its citizens from the effects caused by spread of this pandemic. Most of the media analysts and economists are trying to calculate the negative economic impacts posed to different countries affected by the spread of COVID-19.
"Due to large impact of this pandemic, the global economy is shrinking; imports and exports are falling; same goes for oil prices. Tourism and airlines industries are also facing the worst crisis of this century, resulting in huge financial loss to them."
"Other than this new coronavirus, there is another virus getting less importance in international media. A virus which infected the global conscience and as a result of which conscience of global community is sleeping. The more severe challenge as compared to ‘economic shrinking’ is the ‘sinking of humanity’."
The world is plunging into total chaos; things are getting worse day by day. New calamities – human-made and natural – have been wreaking havoc on humanity. Only time will tell to what extent humans will survive.
"Recently, Syrian observatory for human rights released its report on completion of a decade of war in Syria. According to this report 1, 60,000 civilians died (among them 22,000 children and 16,000 women) and 11 million Syrian people became refugees during this ten years of war."
"Similarly, in Afghanistan thousands of civilians got killed in 18 years of war. Civilian casualties are still happening every day in Yemen, Palestine, Iraq and Myanmar. Economies and infrastructure of these countries got destroyed completely by the wars waged on their territories by international powers for their own petty interests. No one opposed them and stopped them at that time and still there is no one to stop them, as they continue playing their proxy wars with the blood and flesh of poor human beings living in war zones.    "
"Indian Occupied Kashmir is under lock down from August 5, 2019, after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of Indian constitution ending the special autonomous state of Kashmir. It’s now eight months being passed and life is still paralyzed in Kashmir. Humanitarian crisis emerged in Kashmir region where 8 million people are in constant state of curfew but whole world is silent and no one is speaking to end the sufferings of Kashmir’s people."
"Last month, we have seen the brutal riots in Delhi (Indian Capital) in which almost 41 Muslims (protesting against the discriminatory Citizen Amendment Act) martyred in mob attacks by RSS and BJP Hindu workers. These extremist Hindu’s specifically targeted the Muslim community with the support of government security forces. No one condemned this repression and human rights violations in India, except Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian Supreme Leader AyotUllah Khamenei."
"The institutions like United Nations, European Union, UNHCR, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International were established to raise voice against these grave human rights violations in which people of war affected areas face the shortage of food, medicines and lack of shelter. They are forced to live in camps like migrants on their own land. Sadly, all the international actors have closed their eyes and remained quiet on this global human rights crisis. They are only giving statements without taking special measures to put pressure on international community."
"Unfortunately, the reason behind the lack of international organizations role in dismantling the war crimes is deliberate ignorance of severe human rights violations by the global community. Because they did not got effected directly by these battles being played on ground of other countries."
"That’s the reason they remained silent but now when their economic interests are at risk due to corona pandemic, they are doing everything to protect and save their economic interests. They are now lecturing and preparing whole world to fight collectively with this danger. It’s time to adopt a coordinated and prioritize effort without any selfish desires of power and wealth to save humanity, which is at constant loss and becoming rare with every passing day."
Coronavirus and distance learning
"Coronavirus, globally known as COVID-19, has shaken the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “More than 392,000 people have been infected by coronavirus globally and more than 17,000 have died.” The virus outbreak was reported from the Wuhan city of China for the first time. The different kind of the point of views came out about the outbreak, but the way Chinese authorities, especially doctors and nurses, tried hard to curb the virus is remarkable. Such kind of dedication has set an example for the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 did not remain restricted to China until it could have been eradicated once for all, but it spread other parts of the world as well. Till now, coronavirus has affected more than one hundred and sixty countries. It was expected that the COVID-19 could also cross the Pakistan-China border because a huge number of Pakistani students are admitted to Chinese universities. Surprisingly, the pandemic reached Pakistan not through China but Iran."
"Iran is one of the most affected countries and more than eleven hundred fatalities from the coronavirus have been recorded so far. Due to such an outbreak in Iran, the virus also reached Pakistan through the infected Pakistani pilgrims who returned from Iran via Taftan, a town located in Chagai District Balochistan. The pilgrims went from Taftan to different provinces, especially Sindh and Punjab. The majority of pilgrims were sent to Sukkur city of Sindh and DG Khan in Punjab, where they have been quarantined in quarantine centers. However, Sindh is leading in coronavirus positive cases, but the number is increasing in Punjab and other provinces/regions as well. This situation created panic and as a result, during a meeting of the National Security Committee it was decided to close all educational institutions till April 5, 2020."
"This is a very alarming situation that the exams for matriculation and also the Cambridge school system were to be held this month, have been postponed. And, as the numbers of COVID-19 positive cases are increasing day by day, it is expected that the period for the closure of educational institutions will further be extended. In this critical situation, it has been decided by the Higher Education Commission to hold online classes so that the term of the semester in universities may not be increased. But, this has still been remaining a challenge on how to manage the online class system?"
"Even in many rural areas and the countryside, people have no access to electricity properly"
"The online learning system is not a new phenomenon in Pakistan, as the distance learning programs have already been run in the country but the scope of these programs has remained very limited. The Virtual University and Allama Iqbal University are vivid examples in this regard. Still, the question arises that is this possible for all the students countrywide to participate in this online learning process? I am sure the answer is No because Pakistan is not only a developing country but is also far away from the digitalization process that the West, Europe, and even China are experiencing. Despite this, according to the United Nations, “More than 770 million learners worldwide are now being affected by school and university closures.” Even China, being a second-largest economy of the world, had faced many challenges when the Chinese authorities announced the online learning system during the severity of COVID-19 in China."
"In February 2020, almost 200 million kids across China started their classes online. The logic behind starting the online classes was elaborated as “Stop classes but don’t stop learning.” But, China had also faced many hardships during the online learning process. According to Raymond Zhong, who wrote in his article published in the New York Times on March 17, 2020, “In China, many parents cannot afford to buy multiple devices for themselves and their children, even though many of the world’s cheapest smartphones – and most of the fanciest ones, too – are made in China. The nation is blanketed in 4G service, yet the signal is spotty in parts of the countryside. Home broadband can be expensive outside big cities.”"
"He further elaborates, “Between 56 million and 80 million people in China reported lacking either an internet connection or a web-enabled device in 2018, according to government statistics. Another 480 million people said they did not go online for other reasons – for instance, because they didn’t know how.”"
"Though Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken the “Digital Pakistan” initiative, which should be appreciated and encouraged, the major concern is to make it possible as soon as possible. Now, when the online learning process has been initiated by HEC which has asked universities to facilitate students through online measures so that precious time can be saved, I believe, this process would further create a class and also a rural-urban divide. The major issue being faced by the people of Pakistan, in terms of digitization, is that a vast population has no access to the internet. Even in many rural areas and the countryside, people have no access to electricity properly, where loadshedding is a common practice. In these circumstances how is it possible for all students to get the same education? For example, how can a student in urban centers have all facilities, and the other one, who lives somewhere in tribal and remote areas learn the same way?"
"I, being a faculty member, also support the idea that time of students, faculty, and staff should be saved, but until and unless we adopt a proper digital system, which can guaranty that every student would get distance education the same way, we will follow all instructions by HEC just as a formality. Though we do not know when we can get rid of this COVID-19, as the strategy has been adopted by the Government of Sindh seems more suitable in this regard."
"The Sindh government has closed all the educational institutions till May 30, 2020. The time which is to be wasted because no online classes will be conducted, be subsidized through the cancellation of summer vacations. Likewise, still, we are listening from different unofficial sources that the educational institutions will remain closed till June, but the online classes will remain in effect. Simultaneously, the HEC officials, along with university administrations and some other concerned persons, trying their best to find a way to make the online class method effective, which is an appreciable step. Yet, as Pakistan is going to experience this digitized system for the first time in the whole country at a time, it is not easy to make it effective in a short period. Therefore, the concerned authorities should revise their policy in this regard. If they are quite sure that an effective system can be adopted soon, then definitely they should go ahead. But, it must be guaranteed that there will be a uniform education system, in which every student, irrespective of his/her class affiliation and without any rural-urban divide, would be treated equally and get education properly."

Turkey for enhanced people-to-people ties with Pakistan: envoy
ISLAMABAD: Ambassador of Turkey Ihsan Mustafa Yurdakul has said his country was keen to further strengthen and deepen people to people contacts with Pakistan adding cultural diplomacy has a significant role to play in this regard.
"We continue our efforts to increase people to people contacts so as to hand the close bonds inherited from past generations and historical experiences to our future generations,” Yurdakul said in a media interview."
"He said with the contributions of our institutions in Pakistan, like Turkish Maarif Foundation, the Turkish Language Department in the NUML Islamabad, Yunus Emre Turkish Cultural Centre in Lahore, we are serving our significant goal of getting the Turkish and Pakistani peoples even closer."
"In 2017, we celebrated the 70th year of Pakistan’s creation as well as the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Pakistan with reciprocal cultural events”."
"Ambassador Yurdakul further said people of Pakistan have a huge interest in Turkish culture. “We are trying our best to reciprocate this demand. With our cultural events, we aim to promote the cultural, artistic and gastronomic values of our country in Pakistan”."
"In the last two years, the Turkish Embassy has organised events and activities such as “Turkish Food Festival”, “Turkish Movie Nights”, “traditional Turkish art courses”, “photography exhibitions”. We are also celebrating our important days in different universities of Pakistan, he added."
"We also have some projects on common historical heritage of both countries. With the support of our relevant institutions, we aim to realize these projects in the near future”."
"While talking about trade and economic relations the ambassador said even though it is at a significant level, over the years the economic relations relatively lapse behind the historical, cultural and political relations between Turkey and Pakistan."
Economic relations have not yet made the big leap that we all expected and it is well behind its potential.
"One can point out several reasons for that, but today most of these reasons are not on the table anymore. The leaders of the two countries are aware of this and showing the necessary leadership to put the economic relations back on the growth path."
"Right now, the two sides are very near to conclude the Strategic Economic Framework that will provide an action plan to enhance the economic relations, he added."
"The ambassador told the bilateral trade volume was over 1 billion USD five years ago with a high trade surplus of Pakistan. Today, the volume is around 790 million USD but we have more balanced trade, which we believe, is more sustainable."
"However, these levels are just not acceptable when you have a 200 million country on one side and 80 million on the other with significant industrial capacity and a background of excellent political, cultural and historical relations. We hope the bilateral trade will keep its course and continue to increase over the years."
"On the other hand, trade volume is just the tip of the iceberg. Economic relations contain several components such as investments, tourism, defence industry, transportation, etc. and I am very happy to see in every single component we are improving our relations”."
Turkish companies have investments of more than 1 billion USD in Pakistan and this does not include the construction projects carried out by Turkish companies which value around 3.4 billion USD.
"There are 24 Turkish companies in Pakistan that create employment for more than 6,000 Pakistanis."
More is yet to come as we see newcomers like Hayat Kimya and some well-established Turkish companies like Arçelik (Dawlance) recently announced to expand their operations in Pakistan.
The ambassador said he sincerely believed that economic relations will gain speed and achieve these goals.
"I think the sky is the limit for our economic relations because there is no other example of two countries with excellent political relations like Turkey and Pakistan. It is time for it to reflect on the economic relations, he concluded."

Why are Pakistanis keen to learn Chinese language?
"An increasing number of Pakistanis are learning the Chinese language, hoping to land a job in one of the multi-billion-dollar CPEC projects. Some experts see the trend as China's cultural onslaught on Pakistani society. Photo: Deutsche Welle"
"In the past few years – mainly after the announcement of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project in 2015 – there has been an unprecedented surge in the number of students wanting to learn Chinese,"" said Misbah Rasheed, a Chinese language instructor at the Islamabad-based National University of Modern Languages (NUML)."
"Prior to CPEC we had some 200 students learning Chinese. Now we have over 2,000 in our different programs,"" Rasheed told DW."
"Rasheed said the university established a Chinese language department in the 1970s solely for the purpose of familiarizing Pakistani military officials with Chinese culture. Later, the department was opened to common citizens also."
"There has been a sudden interest in learning Chinese – mainly the most-spoken Mandarin variety in China – in the Islamic country. Experts say it is a result of the multibillion-dollar CPEC initiative, which is mainly a trade route, but will also generate jobs in Pakistan."
"In 2015, China announced CPEC worth $46 billion (41 billion euros). With the project, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter US and Indian influence. CPEC also includes plans to create road, rail and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East."
Pakistan is grappling with an acute economic crisis. Experts say that CPEC can certainly stir the much-needed economic activity in the country.
"As a result of an increasing demand for knowledge about China, many private institutions have also started offering Mandarin courses."
"We are offering diplomas for Chinese language programs. Our institute is working in collaboration with Chinese authorities. In the past few years, we have also offered scholarships to more than 1,000 students,"" Muhammad Haseeb, the project manager at Islamabad-based Confucius Institute, told DW."
"We have branches in the cities of Lahore, Karachi and Faisalabad. The project will help China and Pakistan overcome communication gap. It will also help our students to land jobs as interpreters and translators in various China-Pakistan joint projects,"" elaborated Haseeb."

"Sana Bashir, who is studying Mandarin at Confucius Institute, says that after getting her diploma, she would like to go to China."
"I believe the promotion of Chinese language is a good move because it will increase employment opportunities for Pakistani students,"" she told DW."
"Maria Akhtar, a NUML student, says she got motivated to learn Chinese while working as an intern at Huawei’s Islamabad office."
"The company encouraged its employees to learn Chinese language as those with better Chinese language skills have a better chance of excelling in the organization,"" Akthar told DW."
"For Pakistan, China has become more important than ever before, says development analyst Maqsood Ahmad Jan."
"Jan goes on to say that Pakistan has sold out to China for $46 billion. ""I think the Chinese aid is not for free. Pakistan’s economy is not that big, so Beijing will now take over most of our income-generating sectors."""
"Some Pakistani experts even see a Chinese ""cultural colonization"" of the country."
"It is true that learning languages broadens our worldview. But China is also extending its cultural dominance through economic projects,"" Mir Muhammad Ali Talpur, a cultural analyst, told DW."
"It will have an impact on Pakistan’s already diminishing languages. The economic activity will spread Chinese culture to our society. This will harm indigenous cultures,"" Talpur added."
"Asim Sajjad Akhtar, a political analyst and columnist, concurs: ""Our society has been greatly influenced by English culture. Now it will be influenced by Chinese culture and civilization. Chinese influence is visible not only on our culture but also on our economy and politics,"" Akhtar told DW."
"Akram Dashti, former speaker of Baluchistan’s provincial assembly, says China is applying the tried and tested method of colonization in Pakistan."
"First introduce your culture, then language, and then invade domestic economy by increasing trade and commerce activities. Behind all this, China has an eye on Pakistan’s untapped natural resources. China is also looking for new markets and trade routes,"" Dashti told DW."

Foreign language interest on the rise among Pakistanis
"People aiming to become global citizens by learning Chinese, German, French, Spanish and Korean"
"Department of Korean at NUML, established in 2006, is the pioneer Korean language institute in Pakistan. It now has now reached up to 180 students per semester."
"Pakistanis have lately discovered the importance of a well-known quote by freedom fighter Nelson Mandela: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.”"
"Many Pakistanis, eager for better jobs, foreign opportunities and brighter futures, are becoming proficient in a language other than their native Urdu and English language."
"There was a time when Arabic and Persian were the only foreign languages Pakistanis could use. Arabic, traditionally, was learned as a religious duty and a medium to understand the Quran better. Persian was learned to develop knowledge, literary skills and woo ladies with romantic poetry. “Pakistan’s national poet, Allama Iqbal, has written primarily in Persian language, which was also the court language during Mughal Empire” explains Dr Mohammad Safeer, a Persian linguist. Pakistanis, however, drifted away from Arabic and Persian because of few prospects, no interaction and recognition at home and abroad."
"Young Pakistanis are now passionately devoting their time to learn other languages. At the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) in Islamabad — Pakistan’s oldest and esteemed foreign language institute — classes of Chinese, German, French and Korean are crowded with students, says Dr Anwer Mahmoud, dean of Faculty Languages at NUML and PhD in German."
"Language and culture are undeniably intertwined, says Dr Mahmoud. Cultural exchange programmes play a substantial role in instilling the love of language and promoting interaction among cultures."
"Pakistan-China friendship and multicultural activities has certainly spurred interest in Chinese language. When the Chinese department was founded 44 years ago at NUML and classes began in 1970, there were two Chinese teachers and 13 students. This number has now swelled to dozens of teachers and almost 1,000 students, says Rukhsana Hassan recalling her early teaching days."
But why are so many Pakistani students keen to learn a language so different and usually considered difficult to learn?
"Hassan, Assistant Professor of Chinese language, has a very logical explanation: “China is the economic powerhouse, so its language inevitably will be more economically valuable.” She added: “When Pakistan was founded, it was believed that English language skills can instantly get you a job, now it is only fair to say that Chinese language will open new avenues of development.”"
"China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has invigorated not only economic but also cultural, social ties and amplified interest in Chinese language, agrees Nayyar Nawaz, Chinese language teacher."
"Ma Xu, Chinese language teacher at Confucius Institute in Islamabad, says Pakistanis are reasonable learners. The enhanced awareness, people-to-people linkages and improved scholarship opportunities have shifted the trend towards Chinese language, he believes."
"More than 14,000 Pakistani students are now pursuing higher studies in China, out of which “around 3,600 are studying on scholarship” in the year 2016, according to Zhao Lijian, Charge d’Affairs and Political Counselor of the Embassy of People’s Republic of China in Pakistan."
"In Islamabad alone, many prominent institutes including NUST, COMSATS, City School, Beaconhouse School and Headstart School are teaching Chinese language."
"Falak Naz, 20, however had a unique reason for learning Chinese language. “My brother is married to a Chinese girl, so I am learning the language to better communicate with my sister-in-law.”"
"Among European languages, German is gradually becoming popular and primarily sought for future studies, apprises the Head of German Language Department at NUML, Tausif Amira. During her 25-year teaching career, she has witnessed a huge shift towards German in Pakistan. “There has been a 100 per cent increase in number of students since 2012 with currently 500 students per year at NUML.” The German government’s welcoming policies, educative activities by Goethe-Institut (the official language and cultural centre), and tuition-free education in Germany are the reasons Pakistanis are encouraged to study German."
"Another language fascinating Pakistanis is French — the language of culture, love and royalty. “French was once considered language of the elite, the lingua franca of Europe. That charm is no more there” but it still is a very useful language, says Dr Amna Niaz, French linguistic expert. “The trend is slightly declining but there are about 60 students per semester at NUML.” Higher studies and family sponsorship, is what drives most of the students to learn French. Alliance Française is the official organisation acquainting Pakistanis with French language and francophone culture."
"To the surprise of many, a great number of young Pakistani male students are learning Korean. Department of Korean at NUML, established in 2006 is the pioneer Korean language institute in Pakistan. Dr Atif Faraz, Director of Islamabad King Sejong Institute, says the department had a modest start with three students in 2006 and has now reached up to 180 students per semester. “The main charm for students studying Korean is employment or training opportunities in South Korea”. However, frequent cultural activities and interaction by Korean Embassy has stimulated interest in the language."
"Japanese Government has been involved in improving and deepening Pakistan-Japan cultural ties through exchanges in culture, sports, youth and education. Japan also assists language institutes in Pakistan by offering a language laboratory, training and donating books."
"Turkish language had a rather late entry into Pakistani society, initiated by the opening of dozen of Pak-Turk International Schools and Colleges network in Pakistan. Today, there are more than around 10,000 students studying at 28 schools."
"Chinese, Arabic, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Turkish are the languages of the future, according to linguistic scholars."
"Foreign languages have become an integral part of the globalised world. However, the focus of language education in the 21st century is less on grammar and memorisation and more on using language as a means to communicate and connect, according to Mahmoud. The rising trends of foreign language learning is heartening and empowering Pakistanis to truly become global citizens."
Pakistan’s economy and the irrationality of capitalism
"The ruptured condition of Pakistan’s economy and its continuous efforts to extricate itself from the debt trap under capitalism takes us back to the Marxist view of the world. After every downturn in the economy, voices appear suggesting the veracity of the Marxist perceptive critique of capitalism. Pakistan is on its way to improve its undermined economic growth, rising unemployment, stagnant wages, the dominance of large and powerful firms in this highly competitive era. Marx criticized the competition between markets by claiming that the larger firms would exploit the smaller ones by driving them out of business. As they are highly competitive and advanced in technology, they would enjoy the surpluses while giving rise to inequality."
"Capitalism encourages the collective efforts to help save the drowning economy of the weak with the help of foreign aid, loans and investment. The European Marshall Plan with the U.S 12billion dollars aid to Europe provided a remarkable example of the success of capitalism. It showed a combination of economic growth, increased productivity, rising wages and technological innovation and social insurance between Western Europe, North America and Japan. For a while, Marx seemed wrong but after the 1970s economic crisis in Europe, it appeared that Capitalism was not built to last. The world saw an end of a mixed economy of the West following the crisis. The governments impeded the economic efficiency, the welfare state was damaged and elites separated themselves with independent central banks. Today, Pakistan is facing the worst economic downturn with the revenue shortfall, imbalance between trade and fiscal deficits, less value-added and manufactured products for trade and its inability to compete in the world"
"The problem is not a sudden crisis of capitalism, but the gradual revival of pathologies that the developed world has tied us into. Despite the huge foreign aid by the developed world, a loan from IMF, the country’s economy is not sustainable for long term growth because of stringent economic and political conditions attached which are detrimental to economic and political stability in a country. Marx said that production is organized in the interests of the capitalist class rather than those of society as a whole. Its reflection can be seen by opening up the domestic market to exports from the donor country, thus posing a challenge to the industry in the recipient country. This helps improve the donating country’s economy by using financial aid as a pretext. Moreover, political stipulations are another cause of unrest; a receiving state is bound to support the political agenda and ideology of the donor’s state. For instance, in the 1980s, foreign aid from America tied Pakistan to support the American war aginst the Soviets in Afghanistan. In the post, the 9/11 era to Pakistan had to reluctantly support American troops against the Taliban. As stated by American politician Lee Hamilton, ‘’Foreign aid is an important tool of American foreign policy which can serve the interests of the United States.’’ Capitalism is the rhetoric of the United States as the best system for bringing economic prosperity."
"On the other hand, China challenged the status-quo without changing its ideology; following Socialism."
"The intellectual economist John Maynard Keynes argued that it is not the investment decisions of capitalists that drive the economic activity but consumption decisions of ordinary people. But the demands imposed by capital accumulation and profitability would limit the choices for governments to develop long term economic reforms. On the other hand, the economist James Meade presented his solution to save egalitarian, social-democratic capitalism. He shed light on buttressing the welfare state’s redistribution of income with a redistribution of capital assets. So that everyone could be benefited. James’ view could be a part of one solution to the ills of capitalism."
Is the capital a drug haven for students?
"I Afridi’s statement sends ripples of shock I Police and parents appalled by the claim, term it unfactual"
"The statement of Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi that around 45 to 75 percent of students in Islamabad are addicted to drugs, seems not only far away from reality but it has also posed a serious question mark on the performance of the departments mandated to check the menace, according to the stakeholders."
Parents have urged the state minister to put his own house in order first to provide a ‘drug free’ environment to students in the capital city before making such an exaggerated statement.
The minister’s statement was based on a survey of the city’s educational institutions. He had stated that the students were using drugs like ice and crystal meth.
"As per data collected by The Nation, there are around 25 public/private sector universities, 1242 private schools and 423 public sector schools and colleges functional in the city. In around 1690 institutions, providing education from primary to PhD level, there are approximately over one million (11, 77,000) students. The statistics maintained by the regulating departments suggest that around 6, 50,000 students are enrolled in the universities, 3, 10,000 in private schools and 2, 17,000 in public sector institutions."
Trump criticizes US media for ignoring COVID-19 issue when covering protests
"There are approximately 647350 male students while 529650 female students are enrolled in Islamabad’s educational institutions. Going by the statement of the minister of state, there are 397237 female students addicted to drugs (75 percent of the total) and 291307 male students addicted to drugs (45 percent of the total) in Islamabad. In other words, there are over half a million drug addicts amongst the students only and what to talk of the rest of the city’s population.   "
"Key officials of the education sector and rehabilitation centers have expressed astonishment over the figures quoted by the state minister of students in the city who are addicted to drugs. They even doubted the survey exercise in the city’s schools and colleges and declared the claim of the minister as an irresponsible statement. “Where is that survey? If the claim is right then it’s the failure of the local police and Anti-Narcotics Force which failed to stop the menace,” said Prof Tahir Malik at National University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad. He said samples, statistics and results of the survey are shared for public information. “If the situation is so grave, the government should declare war against narcotics,” he opined. "
13 year old girl martyred by unprovoked Indian firing across LoC
Resident Officer (RO) of Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) Gul Majeed Rao said that he was startled by the figures that the minister quoted about the number of students in the city who are addicted to drugs. He held it impossible that such a large number of students are involved in the menace.
"Students do consume drugs in the university but the police and local administration has failed in cutting the supply line,” he said."
He accused the police of being reluctant in registering cases against individuals found to be in possession of drugs.
"There is an increase in consumption of drugs by the students but action needs to be taken in the suburbs of the institutions. Students do not prepare drugs in the universities,” said the RO."
"Hamid Khan, a representative of Parents Association of Private Schools said that the figure given by the minister seems exaggerated and could be challenged; however, he was of the view that elite private schools needs to be disciplined. “Whether it’s 75 percent or 1 percent, it needs to be stopped, because use of drugs in elite schools is becoming an attraction for students,” he said. He was of the view that a certain percentage of male and female students from rich backgrounds are involved in using drugs and it is because the administration has failed in busting the network of drug dealers’."
Global coronavirus cases exceed 8.9 million
"Zaafran Elahi, President Private Schools Association declared the MoS for Interior’s claim as a flat statement and demanded him to resign from the position. “Why didn’t they conduct raids and arrest the culprits?” he questioned. He said that the government didn’t conduct any survey in the schools recently, adding that the minister gave a vague statement and has accused the students. “How will the parents trust and send their children to school? The minister has embarrassed parents and students,” he lamented. Zaafarn Elahi said that individual reported cases could not be overlooked but blaming the majority of students and particularly female students is an unfair act on part of the minister."
"Ch. Ghulam Abbas, a resident of sector G-14 speaking on behalf of the parents said that the statement is nothing but an exaggeration. “How did the minister find out that such a large number of students are addicts? Actually, the minister dubbed every second student as an addict, which is not the case,” he said and added that the statement has put the parents and the children in an embarrassing situation."
World Hydrography Day: Understanding hydrography and enabling autonomous technologies
The rehabilitation centers for drug addicts have experienced a surge in the number of patients visiting centers in the recent days; however no specific increase of female and male students was reported or witnessed there.
Dr Sajjad from Brain Care Center Rehabilitation Center told The Nation that the center’s OPDs are receiving around 100 patients per month and they come from different backgrounds.
"He said that the use of ICE has increased among the patients but still there is no surge in the number of patients, as the families are reluctant to bring their children in such centers because of social issues. He added that ICE is becoming more popular amongst elite school’s students because their students can afford it."
"Manager Emaan Clinic, Asad Rafique viewed that drug addiction amongst females is not more than one percent while the female patients do not necessarily include female students. He said that ICE is getting popular in all age groups, while the patients of drug addiction come from different backgrounds including educated and uneducated strata."
FM Shah Mehmood Qureshi hails Bozkir’s UNGA presidency
Professor Tahir Mehmood from Islamabad Model Post Graduate College (IMPGC) sector H-8 dubbing the minister’s views as an irresponsible statement said that even 2 percent in any institution is a big claim.
"He said that no such team has paid a visit to carry out this very survey recently, while the minister’s statement has shattered the parents trust. He said that action was required to be taken if the drugs were being consumed in such a big quantity. He also said that students enrolled in government schools and colleges cannot afford to purchase expensive drugs like ICE and heroin."
"Acting Chairman Private Education Institutions Regulatory Authority (PEIRA) Imtiaz Quershi said that taking action against drug peddlers is the responsibility of the Anti-Narcotics Force and the administration. “It’s the administration’s job to stop easy availability of drugs to students,” he lamented."
Renowned scholar Mufti Naeem passes away at 62
"Meanwhile, Islamabad police held 1317 drug-peddlers in the first 11 months of the outgoing year 2018 including 81 involved in supplying drugs at educational institutions of the federal capital, according to the data."
"However, according to the sources, no student was booked for the crime. The police, acting on the complaints of either the school administration or parents, arrested more than 70 drug peddlers but not a single student."
"Talking to this scribe on condition of anonymity, the police officials said that implicating such a large number of students in the menace is just a claim beyond reality. The ground reality suggests a totally different picture. “Students smoke, they use charas, alcohol and in some cases ICE as well, but the figure quoted by the minister is simply too much,” said a senior police official requesting not to be named. "
"The police had recovered 402kg charas, 69kg heroin, 7kg opium, 1kg cocaine, 1kg ICE and 22467 bottles of liquor from various drug pushers during the outgoing year, but never moved against a student. The educational institutions have no record of students addicted to drugs, if any, according to the police officials. Most of the accused were arrested from outside Urdu University in sector G-7, Islamic International University, QAU, COMSATS University, F-7/2 school, Riphah University and other educational institutions of the city."
Saudi Arabia ends nationwide curfew and lifts restrictions
"No doubt the drug mafia has gained a stronghold in Islamabad’s educational institutions, despite a crackdown by the local police. Scores of students of various universities and colleges in Islamabad have reportedly fallen prey to drug addiction while the police and the authorities seem helpless in curbing the menace. Students are routinely purchasing contraband as the drug dealers are just a phone call away."
"The network of drug dealers is so strong and organized that the service is available 24 hours, according to the sources in the local police."
"The increasing trend of drug consumption in the institutes has posed a serious threat to the lives of students. According to police sources, majority of students addicted to drugs in Islamabad belong to the upper-middle and upper class, and have no issue of affordability. In its drive against drugs on campus, Islamabad police has arrested peddlers involved in the sale of contraband."

"Schools, colleges and universities in the federal capital are fast turning into drug peddlers’ favorite haunts as they can find a large number of young customers there."

24 press officers being inducted for foreign posting
Interviews for the lucrative foreign posting of 24 press officers are being held tomorrow at the Ministry of Information despite strong protest by a number of Information Group officers who have urged the government to cancel the process owing to alleged massive irregularities.
At least 10 officers of Information Group have written representations to Secretary Information Imran Gardezi pointing out violation of rules in the appointment process.
"The secretary information was not available for comments. A senior official, however, rejected all charges of irregularities in the appointment process. He said the whole process is transparent. It always happen that those not selected start raising allegations. They did not accept their weakness but claim deficiencies in others. This is a way to keep up pressure. This is not a new thing, he asserted."
"According to the representation of said officers, a copy of which is available with The News, the selection process for the Press Officers in foreign missions is being conducted in the most unfair, discriminatory and non-transparent manner."
The letter includes a list of 10 deserving officers who were ignored in the process of recruitment while names of 10 officers with ineligibilities are also part of the representation.  The officers have pointed out a number of procedural irregularities and gross violations of various directives of the prime minister in the process.  
"The External Publicity Wing of the Ministry has initiated the process of posting of Information Group Officers in the Pakistani Missions abroad and conducted a written test on 15th March. “Information Group officers are highly perturbed because of violations of policy and blatant display of nepotism and prejudice in the whole process,” the letter says."
"According to letter, the process was initiated without formulating a specified criterion for determining the eligibility for foreign postings and implementation was started in a haphazard manner. "
Under the policy guidelines for foreign posting issued by the PM Office on 13th February 2016 a written test for cadre post is not recommended.
"Interestingly results of the test have already become controversial as 14 out of 36 officers who appeared obtained less than 60% marks and were declared ""failed"" but later on decision was altered as some of the favorites were among the failed lot."
"Now all those who appeared in the test have been called for interview on May 11, 2016, resulting in dismay of the officers who passed the exam, making the entire episode further controversial. "
Numerous officers eligible according to the policy guideline and initial shortlist were not invited for test because of personal grudge and prejudice.
It says 30th September 2015 was the cutoff date for determining eligibility while the test was held on 15th March 2016. There seems no justification for setting of September 30th as the cutoff date.
"It says same test was conducted for the posts of BPS 18, 19 and 20 despite the fact that the job description and experience of these grades are not same. “Instead of LUMS or IBA, written test was conducted through the NUML which stands at 31st in HEC ranking of universities. This is gross violation of PM Office OM/foreign Posting guidelines,” it says."
"A practicing journalist and faculty member at Mass Communications department of NUML who himself was an applicant for the foreign posting when advertised in September 2015, participated in "
preparation & checking of papers. 
The letter mentioned a number of officers not eligible according to the Estacode guideline for foreign postings abroad & prime minister’s directives who were invited for test and interview.
"Seven officers who have availed foreign posting and are in promotion zone are invited for the test and interview. Their posting will usurp the right of many deserving and eligible officers in same grades who have not yet availed foreign posting and would also block seats affecting promotional prospects of junior officers,” it adds."
One of the officers who already returned without competing her earlier foreign posting earning adverse remarks from her ambassador is being favored in this process again at the cost of other deserving officers.  The letter requested the Secretary to stop the recruitment process and constitute a committee to look into the issue.
HEC halts indigenous scholarship programme in many varsities 
"The Higher Education Commission (HEC), Islamabad has suspended indigenous PhD and MPhil scholarships in around 150 universities."
"According to the information available withDaily Times,the commission recently decided not to entertain the students of 150 universities for Indigenous MPhil/MS and PhD scholarships of batch-V under Indigenous fellowship Program."
"The information stated that out of over 200 public and private sector varsities across the country, the HEC reaffirmed only 66 universities in bother sector for awarding indigenous scholarships of said bath sector academia."
"The list of universities in the federal have been approved for scholarships includes National University of Modern Languages (NUML), COMSATS University of Information Technology, Air University, Bahria University, Capital University of Science and Technology, Institute of Space Technology, International Islamic University, Islamabad, National University of Sciences & Technology, National Institute of Psychology of Quai-i-Azam University, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Quaid-i-Azam University."
"Sources within HEC said that this regretful decision, which was taken by the senior management, would deprive the hundreds and thousands of students from obtaining their doctoral degrees."
"Interestingly, over 20 universities out of these 66 universities valid for scholarships are private. While commenting on this, a senior official, under the condition ofanonymity, said that it was quite surprising that the HEC preferred the private sector universities which were attended by relatively privileged students who could easily afford education-related expenses compared to public sector universities."
"The HEC charges Rs 500 per student as processing fee to apply for such scholarship programs. According to the sources, as many as 70,000 students of these banned universities applied for HEC scholarships. This means that the relevant authorities in the commission collected around Rs 30 million (m) from the poor students in the way of non-refundable scholarship application fee."
"According to the documents, a total of 2031 ingenious scholarships were awarded for under graduate, post graduate, and PhD studies under various schemes during financial year 2017-18. Apart from some other schemes, the government had planned to produce 25000 PhDs locally under single project under indigenous fellowship Program in vision 20-25. Before this, the HEC officially admitted that there is shortage of 38000 PhD scholars in the country."
"A few years ago, the HEC formulated strict rules to ensure the provision of quality education in the country’s varsities. The commission directed all public and private sector varsities to implement these laws. One of these rules stated that at least three PhD full time faculty members were required to start any new academic program. “How can the universities comply by HEC rules if it starts closing PhD and MPhil relief study programs at a point in time where there is a shortage of academics and scholars,” questioned an HEC official who wished not to be named."
"Meanwhile, the educationists are also mulling over this decision .Former chairman of HEC, Dr Atta Ur Rehman said that after 2008, the government as well as the commission administration ruined the quality of education in varsities. Dr Rehman, who is also among the pioneers of HEC said,“Number of universities now in the country is increased very significantly but nobody focused on the quality of education.” He said that the incumbent administration should re-store all important projects that had been shut down."
"Criticising the decision, Atta Ur Rehman said that it was very surprising that indigenous scholarship programs, which encouraged as well as economically supported poor students, were being suspended. The former chairman said that he started many projects and faculty development program was one of them but they were not continued properly."
"However, HEC chairman Dr Tariq Banuri defended the decision. He maintained that there were quality issues in some varsities due to which they have been exempted from this program. “The quality education in our higher education sector is my first priority” he claimed and reaffirmed that no university or individual having substandard system would be given any kind of concession in this regard."
"Published in Daily Times, December 26th 2018."
"Coronavirus started from Chinese city Wuhan. Initially it spread only in Wuhan but spread rapidly all over the country first and then to the world. Due to Coronavirus, economic system everywhere in the world collapsed. The virus easily transfers from human to human. Its major symptom is common cold which most of people get in summers and winters."
Many people died due to Coronavirus. It is better to start taking precautionary measures as soon as possible to keep yourself away from virus. It is quite difficult to identify either you have coronavirus or not. Coronavirus affect primarily those who have weak immune system. Immune system protects the body from virus.
"White blood cells, antibodies, and other components, including organs and lymph nodes, make up the body’s immune system. A person who have weak immune system get the infection easily and frequently. One can make one’s immune system strong by some taking some precautions. For instance, they can do so by eating hygienic and by taking exercise daily. Immune system can be protected or make strong by following few tips."
One of the easiest ways for a person with a weak immune system to stay healthy is by practicing good hygiene. To protect yourself from coronavirus; washing hands during the following times is necessary.
Always wash your hands before preparing meal or any snack
Wash your hands before eating
"If you had flu and you are sneezing, blowing your nose or coughing wash your hand"
Wash your hands if you met someone who is unwell
After using or helping your child bathroom wash your hands
If you had infant and you are changing diaper
After touching any wild animal or your pet wash your hands
Wash your hands after garbage disposal
"To make your body strong immune system strong certain foods may help keep your immune system strong. If you are looking for ways to prevent yourself from winter colds, flu and coronavirus."
Citrus fruits help build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. It is key to fighting against the infection and doesn’t produce or store in your body. You need daily dose in your diet to continued health.
Red bell pepper has twice Vitamin C than citrus fruits. Red bell peppers also a rich source of beta carotene. Vitamin C may help maintain healthy skin.

"Garlic and ginger found in almost every cuisine in the world. Garlic add little zing to your food and zing must-have for your health ginger help decrease inflammation, which can help to reduce a sore throat and other inflammatory illnesses."
"There are many others food we use in our daily life to build up strong immune system e.g. shellfish, sunflower seeds, poultry, kiwi, papaya, green tea, turmeric, almonds and yogurt."
More ways to prevent the virus:
"To keep our body healthy, we need variety in our diet. Every person needs balanced diet or in other words some portion of each food to remain healthy. Eating right is a great start to build up your immune system. Balanced diet filled with balanced minerals, fats, and other edible can help improve immune system. It is also the responsibility of government to make sure that instructions are spread in both English and Urdu languages, and if possible in regional languages too."

"Prime Minister Khan, time for action"
"In his response to the Covid-19 crisis, Pakistanis' national leader fell short of inspiring them with hope"
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. Photo: AFP / Aamir Qureshi
"A microscopic virus has brought the entire world to a standstill. Originating from China’s Wuhan province, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 shattered the mirage of man’s control and power."
"As of now, China claims to have successfully contained the contagion, but the rest of the world is at crossroads. As unprecedented as this is, leaders everywhere appear to be helpless in the wake of this global health crisis.  "
"Not even rich and developed countries can cope with it. It is neither a problem of the economy nor of development, but of timely decisions and following strict safety protocols. Taiwan, for one, has managed to accomplish this otherwise impossible task."
"What about developing countries and struggling economies? Pakistan, for instance; can one look beyond despair?"
Covid-19 began spreading in Pakistan with the pilgrims coming back home from Iran via the Taftan border crossing. The pilgrims reportedly were neither tested thoroughly nor quarantined. The result was obvious: The contagion got its chance to spread all across the country.
"The Interior Ministry closed the Afghan border and the Kartarpur Corridor. However, the government stated that Indian Sikh pilgrims would be allowed to visit. One wonders why the issue of closing borders and restricting movement came so late. Incompetence, inconsistency, indecisiveness, prevailing confusion, and inaction are the causes of the outbreak surge in Pakistan."
Plight of the prime minister
"Prime Minister Imran Khan, as leaders are supposed to, came to the fore and spoke to the nation on the outbreak. He informed the people that a lockdown was an impossibility and tried to encourage them while telling them of the awful state of medical facilities in the hospitals. In his second speech, his insistence on delaying the lockdown and the unpreparedness to provide comfort to the nation was itself a reason for panic. While talking to journalists, he was pressed with many questions but could not offer any satisfactory answers."
"There is no denying that these are times of helplessness, but that’s when leaders should rise to the occasion. It is the time when a leader needs to inspire his people with hope. To Pakistanis’ chagrin, their national leader fell short of comforting his people, who had negligible awareness of the disease and were at the risk of losing their lives."
Action not supplication
"Since it was a national crisis, Khan should have given a national response. He should have convened an all-party conference to bring all the stakeholders on board and demonstrated the resolve to move past the political differences this time. Not only politically, but the need of the hour also was to take all the community leaders on board. The chief minister of Sindh, Murad Ali Shah, seemed wiser and did all the right things, including enforcing a lockdown."
"There is a need to chalk out a national plan by mobilizing all the resources at hand. First, the relief package Khan announced on Tuesday must be refined further. For example, how those affected by the crisis will be identified and provided what they need is a huge undertaking. It needs a sharp plan so that the right people get help at the right time."
"It would be more appropriate for the relief plan to be implemented by creating relief zones. For example, in one section of the city, all the political parties of that area, religious leaders, and philanthropists should be given the responsibility to cater to the needs of the people during the lockdown. That would address the issue of rightly identifying the needy people and timely delivery of relief services to them."

"It has been said that the daily wage earners will be the worst hit, but they are not the only ones. It is the middle class that always bears the brunt, such as employees who work on contractual or daily basis, and educators. If their salaries are cut off, even partially, it will result in spreading despair, confusion and ultimately socio-economic chaos."
"Coupled with this is the problem of hoarding. People must be strictly watched as to whether there is any such activity going on anywhere in the country. Failing to ensure this, the country could end up in despair and discontent."
"Second, people are not well aware of the nature of this disease, its symptoms, and how it spreads. A nationwide campaign should be initiated on social distancing."
Third those who are at the forefront of this war are doctors and paramedical staff. Why should they risk their lives? They must be encouraged and paid tribute to while providing them the facilities they need during this time.
"The people of Pakistan have been going through many trials and ordeals. Though Covid-19 is a global issue, in Pakistan it is only adding to the tragedies of the people. How do the people feel after going through this much hardship?"
"A brilliant young poet and social activist, Afkar Alvi, wrote a metaphoric poem, Murshid (“The Mentor”), that aptly describes the despair:"
"Please do not panic” is not the solution. The most important factor that could defeat this disease is timely management. If actions are taken timely, the country will be brought back to normal, restoring faith and hope in the government."

APPLICATIONS ARE INVITED FROM DESERVING STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR AWARD OF SCHOLARSHIPS BY PAKISTAN BAIT-UL-MAL (PBM)
"ISLAMABAD: Arabic is deeply revered in Pakistan for its religious significance, though it is not spoken or understood in the country. However, a bunch of students can be seen at the Department of Arabic at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) who are passionately devoting their time and energy to master the subject."
"“Arabic is the language of heaven,” 21-year-old Zohina Shabbir said while explaining what compelled her to learn the language. “The Qur’an was revealed in this language, making it extremely special for us.”"
Shabbir also described Arabic as a “very comprehensive and interesting” medium of communication.
"It is not surprising that it has traditionally been learned to fulfill one’s religious obligations in Pakistan. A large number of educated Pakistani can read Arabic since their national language, Urdu, uses the same script."
"While Shabbir and some of her friends are learning the language to improve their understanding of Islam, many among the 180 students enrolled in the department are doing it to secure better employment opportunities."
"Most of them become Arabic teachers after completing their course or degree,” informed Dr. Kafait Ullah Hamdani, head of the Arabic language department at NUML. “Some of our students have found jobs at foreign missions. Others are working as interpreters or white-collar workers in the Middle East.”"
"Established in 1973, NUML’s Arabic department is one of the oldest that offers multiple programs that range from 6-month short courses to doctorate in Arabic."
"“It is a matter of great pride for us that our armed forces personnel serving in the Arab world have completed their language courses from NUML,” he said. Most of what is taught at the department is standard Arabic, also known as Fusha."
"Besides NUML and International Islamic University (IIUI), there are a number of institutions, such as the Multan-based Wifaq Ul Madaris Al Arabia that enrolled about 377,575 students in 2019."
"In recent years, NUML’s Arabic department has also witnessed an interesting trend."
"“Almost 70 percent of students currently enrolled in the master’s program are Chinese,” said Dr. Kafait."
He believes this owes to the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that promises to change the region’s economic geography and may give Beijing direct access to Middle Eastern markets.
"“This trend is an example for Pakistanis how should understand how language proficiency in Arabic can enhance our trade and business ties with the Arab world,” he added. “The importance of Arabic, which is spoken by roughly 400 million people, is also growing due to the rising economic and political importance of the Gulf region.”"
"Almost a block away from the department, however, one can see Chinese, Korean and German language centers that are abuzz with students. Compared to them, the Arabic section looks rather quiet."
"According to one faculty member, this can be explained on the basis of people’s passion to go to Europe or China for better employment opportunities. Besides, there are better scholarship facilities available for students proficient at those languages."
"“This is something the Arabic department is missing. To stimulate interest, the government should create better opportunities and incentives for both students and teachers,” said Dr. Abu Bakar, who has been teaching at the facility for the last 19 years."
"Another key factor for declining admissions in the department, he added, was the compulsion of language certificate by some countries, such as South Korea. Arab states, he noted, did not have such requirements."
"“Basic Arabic skills that can be covered in a month would benefit both Pakistani job seekers and Middle Eastern companies,” he said."
"NUML has conducted seminars and arranged cultural activities in collaboration with the Saudi embassy since 2016. “One of the most fruitful of these activities was a teacher training program in 2018 which was conducted by professors from Saudi Arabia and Egypt,” Dr. Abu Bakar said, adding that such exchange programs, which came to a halt after September 11, 2001, were quite helpful in promoting the language."
"Islamabad: Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Monday signed an agreement to develop a volunteer force from the university students. Under the understanding, over 15,000 students of the university would be enrolled as volunteers, enabling them to work in a state of natural or man-made disasters, accidents and community services."
"The agreement was signed by PRCS Secretary General Khalid Bin Majeed and Rector NUML Major General (R) Zia ud Din Najam HI (M) at a ceremony held at Conference Room of NUML, Sector H-9, here. Dean of respective departments of NUML and PRCS officials were also present on the occasion."
"NUML’s Manager Research Operations and Development, Ms. Huma Rasheed gave a detailed presentation on MoU to all the participants. According to the MoU, the students and university staff would be given opportunity to participate in trainings, demonstrations, workshops, seminars and camps. The Society will also organize training sessions for students. The two sides decided to establish working relationship for mobilizing and training youth volunteers. It was also decided that PRCS will establish self-sustainable youth clubs at all departments and campuses of NUML and provide a complete training package for the capacity building of club members."
"Speaking at the occasion, PRCS Secretary General Khalid Bin Majeed said that under the vision and leadership of PRCS Chairman Dr Saeed Elahi, the Society had set a target to increase the volunteer base up to 5 million. Engaging youths of schools, colleges and universities was one of objectives by establishing new Youth Clubs, revitalizing existing ones and imparting training on first aid, disaster management and response during various emergencies. He said that PRCS had recently signed MoUs with the Allama Iqbal Open University and Punjab University and other institutions which is a step towards achieving our milestone and so far PRCS had been able to achieve recruitment of over 1.8 million volunteers."
He appreciated the support of NUML and especially Rector NUML Major General (R) Zia ud Din Najam and hope that both the intuitions will work closely for the betterment of humanity.
"Speaking at the occasion Major General (R) Zia ud Din Najam said that NUML students always played an important role whenever the country faced calamities. He said that the new generation had the passion to serve humanity but needed a platform through which they could participate in relief activities. He said that the MoU would provide NUML students an opportunity to cope with floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters."
"At the end of ceremony, PRCS Secretary General and Rector NUML exchange mementos."

"Islamabad : Two-day National Conference on Education titled ‘Education in 21st Century: Expectations, Challenges, and Possibilities’ organised by Education department, faculty of Social Sciences started here at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Wednesday, says a press release."
"The chief guest of the inaugural session was Prof. Dr. Anees Ahmed, Vice Chancellor Riphah International University, while Rector NUML Major General (Retd) Muhammad Jaffar, Director General Brig Muhammad Ibrahim, Deans, Directors, Heads of Departments, scholars from various universities of Pakistan, faculty members and students also attended the session."
"Speaking on the occasion chief guest Prof. Dr. Anees Ahmed said that prevailing education system is borrowed from the west, which gives knowledge but not wisdom. We once a colonial nation never tried to think critically and never think what Quaid-e-Azam and Iqbal said. While referring to the Quaid’s speech on the first education conference in Dec 1947, Dr. Anees said that according to the Quaid Pakistan needed an education system in which character building should be focused but we never followed our great leader."
"Professor Dr. Anees said that current education system is prison of ideas of the west and we blindly following them, not knowing the fact that this system is hampering the minds of our youth. You can get knowledge but you cannot get wisdom from the current education system. He further said that China, Japan, France and Russia focused on one language at national level and all their programs are in their own languages yet they excel in every field at global level and on other hand we never gives such importance to our national language. “I am not against the indigenous languages but we have to have one language at national level”, he said. He elaborated that there are many native languages and culture in China but you will never see them saying as our fellow Pakistani like Punjabi, Pashtoon, Sindhi, Sarakai, Balouchi and Urdu speakers say."
"Earlier, Rector NUML Major General (r) Muhammad Jaffar in his welcoming address said that education is imperative and inevitable for us in every thinkable walk of life. Let us remind ourselves through this conference how much it is important for us to realize and acknowledge the role of education with all its dynamics in present day Pakistan."
"The rector said that NUML is known to have paved paths for the promotion of research and improved and adaptable educational paradigms. It is moving ahead with considerable efficacy and system. NUML believes that the essential rule of education is research and it has a fundamental role in the development of civilization. The higher standards in research adopted by our faculty and scholars are far encouraging. These will not only expand possibilities of education domestically but also escalate our cultural worth globally. Both research and education thrive upon constructive attitudes of life and restore intellect and knowledge. As a nation, such solemn ideals and practices are needed. Gladly, NUML is playing a commendable role in this regard."

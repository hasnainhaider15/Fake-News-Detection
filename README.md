# Fake-News-Detection
Developed for the final year students of NUML. This project is developed in Python language and I have used Fuzzy Wuzzy algo to achive the requirements of my client including full GUI using PyQt5 framework. Different frameworks are used in this project. Security management is included in this project with proper registeration, forget and login forms and the database is handled through firebase database. The fuzzy wuzzy algo matches strings from a dataset to check the accuracy of the news related to NUML university and displays it into a table view format in the GUI. User has two option to proceed for detection. 1. OCR - Convert image into string and than forward it to the algo to find matches and  display accuracy with matching quries.  2. String input - Give a sentence or a piece of string to forward it to the algo to find matches and display accuracy with matching quries.  It was a paid project.
